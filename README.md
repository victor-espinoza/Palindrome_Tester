# Palindrome_Tester
This is a simple program that tests to see if a phrase is a palindrome or not. This is achieved using recursion to compare the starting character and the ending character to make sure they are the same. The program then makes its way towards the middle of the phrase and compares the characters to each other to make sure that the phrase is in fact a palindrome. Once the program determines whether the phrase is a palindrome or not the results are then outputted to the terminal.
